# How to Use Highext: A Quick Guide

Welcome to Highext! This guide will walk you through turning your highlighted PDFs into structured, easy-to-read summaries in just a few clicks.

# Step 1: Upload Your Highlighted PDF

To get started, you need to upload a PDF that you have already marked up with highlights. You can either drag the file directly into the upload area or click on it to select the file from your computer. Highext will then automatically scan your document.

# Step 2: Teach Highext Your Color System

After your PDF is uploaded, Highext will display all the unique highlight colors it found. This is where the magic happens. For each color, use the dropdown menu to assign a format. For example, you can set rules like:

*   Pink highlights should become a main title (Level 1 Header).
*   Cyan highlights should be a subtitle (Level 2 Header).
*   Yellow highlights can be regular text.

This step allows you to create a perfectly organized document based on the color-coding system you already use.

# Step 3: Extract Your Notes

Once you have assigned a format to each of your colors, simply press the "Extract Text" button. Highext will process your entire PDF, pull out every highlight, and format it according to the rules you just set.

# Step 4: View and Save Your Summary

Your structured summary will instantly appear on the screen. You can review the output in two ways:

1.  **Markdown View:** See the raw text with Markdown formatting.
2.  **PDF Preview:** Generate a clean, professional-looking PDF from your notes, complete with section numbering and a table of contents.

When you are happy with the result, you can click the "Download PDF" button to save your new, organized summary to your device.
